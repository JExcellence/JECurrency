## Requirements
- Java: 21+
- Server: Paper 1.19+ (developed with Paper API 1.21.x)
- InventoryFramework: Already injected by the platform; no separate installation required
- Optional: Vault (softdepend)


## Installation
1. Ensure your server runs the required Paper version and Java runtime.
2. Place the JECurrency jar into the server's `plugins` folder.
3. Start the server to generate configuration and translation files.
4. Optionally configure translations and database settings (see below).


## Configuration
JECurrency ships with structured configuration resources.

### Translations
- Location (resources): `src/main/resources/translations/`
  - `translation.yml`
    - `defaultLanguage: en`
    - `supportedLanguages: [en, de]`
  - `en.yml`, `de.yml` contain comprehensive MiniMessage-styled messages.

Any language is supported: add your own `<lang>.yml` file alongside the existing ones, then include the language code in `supportedLanguages` within `translation.yml`. After saving files, reload translations in-game:
- `/r18n reload` — reloads all translation files
- `/r18n missing` — opens a locale browser; inspect missing keys per locale with pagination

The missing-keys browser highlights absent entries and shows detected placeholders to help you complete translations.

### Database
A sample Hibernate properties file is included:
- Location (resources): `src/main/resources/database/hibernate.properties`
- Contains commented guidance for configuring storage engines (H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server) and schema modes.

If you plan to back JECurrency with a database, review and adapt the Hibernate properties to your environment, then ensure your chosen JDBC driver is present (if not shaded) and any plugin-side configuration aligns with your server setup.

JECurrency declares commands via YAML under `src/main/resources/commands`.

## Developer API
JECurrency registers a public service for integrations.

- Service class: `de.jexcellence.currency.adapter.CurrencyAdapter`
- Registered with Bukkit’s ServicesManager during plugin load
- Also accessible from the JECurrency plugin instance
- Asynchronous by design (returns `CompletableFuture` for most methods)

Access the adapter:
```java
// Using ServicesManager
CurrencyAdapter adapter = Bukkit.getServicesManager().load(CurrencyAdapter.class);

// Or via the plugin instance
JECurrency plugin = JavaPlugin.getPlugin(JECurrency.class);
CurrencyAdapter adapter2 = plugin.getCurrencyAdapter();
```

Common operations (examples):
```java
OfflinePlayer player = ...;
Currency currency = ...; // obtain from repository/cache in your integration

// Query balance (async)
adapter.getBalance(player, currency).thenAccept(balance -> {
    // use balance
});

// Deposit/withdraw (async)
adapter.deposit(player, currency, 100.0).thenAccept(response -> {
    if (response.isSuccess()) {
        // success
    }
});

adapter.withdraw(player, currency, 25.0).thenAccept(response -> { /* ... */ });

// Check currency existence
adapter.hasGivenCurrency("coins").thenAccept(exists -> { /* ... */ });

// Create/delete currency (admin logic)
// adapter.createCurrency(newCurrency, initiatorPlayer);
// adapter.deleteCurrency("coins", initiatorPlayer);
```

Events fired (listen via Bukkit):
- `BalanceChangeEvent` and `BalanceChangedEvent`
- `CurrencyCreateEvent` and `CurrencyCreatedEvent`
- `CurrencyDeleteEvent` and `CurrencyDeletedEvent`

Notes:
- Perform heavy tasks on async threads; UI updates must be scheduled back on the main thread
- The adapter writes transaction/management logs (see CurrencyLog entities)


## Building from Source
Prerequisites:
- JDK 21+
- Gradle wrapper included

Build targets:
