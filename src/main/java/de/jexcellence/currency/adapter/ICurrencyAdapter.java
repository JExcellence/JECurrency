/**
 * Core interface defining the contract for currency management operations within the JECurrency system.
 * <p>
 * This interface serves as the primary abstraction layer for all currency-related operations,
 * providing a comprehensive API for balance management, transaction processing, and entity
 * lifecycle management. All operations are designed to be asynchronous to prevent blocking
 * the main server thread during database operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Core Functionality Areas:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Balance Operations:</strong> Retrieve player balances for specific currencies</li>
 *   <li><strong>Transaction Management:</strong> Handle deposits and withdrawals with validation</li>
 *   <li><strong>Entity Management:</strong> Create and manage players, currencies, and relationships</li>
 *   <li><strong>Query Operations:</strong> Retrieve currency data and player associations</li>
 *   <li><strong>Validation Services:</strong> Check currency existence and data integrity</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Design Principles:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Asynchronous Operations:</strong> All methods return CompletableFuture for non-blocking execution</li>
 *   <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Comprehensive use of @NotNull and @Nullable annotations</li>
 *   <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Support for both entity-based and player-based operations</li>
 *   <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Standardized response patterns using CurrencyResponse</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes:</h3>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface should ensure thread safety, proper error handling,
 * and efficient database access patterns. All monetary operations should include appropriate
 * validation to prevent negative balances and ensure data integrity.
 * </p>
