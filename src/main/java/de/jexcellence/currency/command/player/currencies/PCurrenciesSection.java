/**
 * Command section configuration for the player-accessible currency management command.
 * <p>
 * This section serves as the configuration and registration component for the "pcurrencies"
 * player command within the JECurrency plugin's command evaluation framework. It extends
 * the abstract command section to provide specific configuration for currency operations
 * that can be executed by players with appropriate permissions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Command Integration:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Command Name:</strong> "pcurrencies" - Player-accessible currency management command</li>
 *   <li><strong>Execution Context:</strong> Available to players with appropriate permissions</li>
 *   <li><strong>Framework Integration:</strong> Integrates with the GPEEE evaluation system</li>
 *   <li><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Handles command-specific settings and permissions</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Permission Model:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Player Access:</strong> Command can be executed by players (unlike console-only commands)</li>
 *   <li><strong>Permission-Based Operations:</strong> Different operations require different permission levels</li>
 *   <li><strong>Administrative Functions:</strong> High-privilege operations restricted to administrators</li>
 *   <li><strong>Read-Only Access:</strong> Information viewing available to general users</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Framework Responsibilities:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Registers the command with the evaluation environment</li>
 *   <li>Configures command-specific evaluation parameters</li>
 *   <li>Manages command lifecycle within the plugin system</li>
 *   <li>Provides configuration access to the command implementation</li>
 *   <li>Establishes permission validation framework integration</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Context:</h3>
 * <p>
 * This section is instantiated during plugin initialization and provides the configuration
 * foundation for the {@link PCurrencies} command implementation. It ensures proper integration
 * with the plugin's command evaluation framework and maintains consistency with other
 * player commands in the system. The command supports both command-line interface and
 * graphical user interface modes for enhanced user experience.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Operational Features:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Multi-Modal Interface:</strong> Supports both CLI and GUI interaction modes</li>
 *   <li><strong>Permission Integration:</strong> Seamless integration with permission management systems</li>
 *   <li><strong>Tab Completion:</strong> Intelligent auto-completion for enhanced user experience</li>
 *   <li><strong>Internationalization:</strong> Localized user feedback and error messages</li>
 * </ul>

	 * Constructs a new player currency command section with the specified evaluation environment.
	 * <p>
	 * This constructor initializes the command section with the necessary configuration to
	 * integrate with the GPEEE evaluation framework. The evaluation environment builder
	 * provides the context and configuration needed for command processing, including
	 * variable resolution, expression evaluation, and execution context management.

	 * <h3>Environment Configuration:</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * The evaluation environment builder provides access to plugin services, configuration
	 * settings, and runtime context that the command implementation will need during
	 * execution. This includes access to repositories, adapters, permission systems,
	 * user interface frameworks, and other infrastructure components required for
	 * comprehensive currency management operations.

	 *
	 * <h3>Player Command Integration:</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * The constructor ensures that the command section is properly configured for
	 * player accessibility, including appropriate permission checks, user interface
	 * integration, tab completion support, and internationalization capabilities
	 * that enhance the player experience.
