/**
 * Immutable response object representing the result of a currency operation within the JECurrency system.
 * <p>
 * This record encapsulates all relevant information about a currency transaction or operation,
 * including the amount involved, resulting balance, operation status, and any error details.
 * It serves as a standardized response format for all currency adapter operations, providing
 * consistent feedback to calling code about the success or failure of requested operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Design Principles:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> All fields are final and cannot be modified after creation</li>
 *   <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Uses enum for operation status to prevent invalid states</li>
 *   <li><strong>Comprehensive Information:</strong> Includes all data needed to understand operation results</li>
 *   <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Provides detailed error messages for failed operations</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Patterns:</h3>
 * <p>
 * This response object is returned by all currency operations in the {@link ICurrencyAdapter}
 * interface. Calling code should always check the {@link #isTransactionSuccessful()} method
 * before proceeding with the assumption that an operation completed successfully.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Response Types:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>SUCCESS:</strong> Operation completed successfully with expected results</li>
 *   <li><strong>FAILURE:</strong> Operation failed due to validation, insufficient funds, or other business logic</li>
 *   <li><strong>NOT_IMPLEMENTED:</strong> Requested operation is not supported by the current implementation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param transactionAmount the amount that was modified during the operation (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals)
 * @param resultingBalance the new balance of the account after the operation completed
 * @param operationStatus the status indicating success, failure, or not implemented
 * @param failureMessage detailed error message if the operation failed, null for successful operations
