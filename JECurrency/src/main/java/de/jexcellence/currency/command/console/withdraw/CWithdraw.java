/**
 * Console command implementation for withdrawing currency amounts from player accounts.
 * <p>
 * This command provides server administrators with the ability to remove currency from any player's
 * account directly from the server console. It supports all registered currencies within the
 * JECurrency system and performs comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity and prevent
 * overdrafts or invalid operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Command Syntax:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code /cwithdraw <player> <currency> <amount>}</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Parameters:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>player:</strong> Target player name or UUID (must have played before)</li>
 *   <li><strong>currency:</strong> Valid currency identifier registered in the system</li>
 *   <li><strong>amount:</strong> Positive decimal amount to withdraw (must not exceed current balance)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Operation Flow:</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Validates command arguments and parameter types</li>
 *   <li>Verifies currency exists in the system</li>
 *   <li>Executes withdrawal operation through CurrencyAdapter</li>
 *   <li>Handles response with comprehensive logging</li>
 *   <li>Reports operation results for audit purposes</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Validation Rules:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Player must exist and have played on the server before</li>
 *   <li>Currency identifier must match a registered currency</li>
 *   <li>Withdrawal amount must be positive</li>
 *   <li>Player must have sufficient balance for the withdrawal</li>
 *   <li>Player must have an existing account for the specified currency</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Error Handling:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Invalid player names or UUIDs are rejected with appropriate messages</li>
 *   <li>Non-existent currencies are reported with available alternatives</li>
 *   <li>Insufficient balance scenarios are logged with current balance information</li>
 *   <li>Missing player accounts are logged for investigation</li>
 *   <li>Failed withdrawal operations are logged with full context</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Security Considerations:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Console-only execution prevents player abuse</li>
 *   <li>All operations are logged for comprehensive audit trails</li>
 *   <li>Asynchronous execution prevents server lag during database operations</li>
 *   <li>Balance validation prevents negative balance scenarios</li>
 * </ul>
