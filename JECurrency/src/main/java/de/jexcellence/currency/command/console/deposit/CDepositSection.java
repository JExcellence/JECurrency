/**
 * Command section configuration for the console-based currency deposit command.
 * <p>
 * This section serves as the configuration and registration component for the "cdeposit"
 * console command within the JECurrency plugin's command evaluation framework. It extends
 * the abstract command section to provide specific configuration for deposit operations
 * that can only be executed from the server console.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Command Integration:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Command Name:</strong> "cdeposit" - Console-specific deposit command</li>
 *   <li><strong>Execution Context:</strong> Server console only (no player access)</li>
 *   <li><strong>Framework Integration:</strong> Integrates with the GPEEE evaluation system</li>
 *   <li><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Handles command-specific settings and permissions</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Security Model:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Console Restriction:</strong> Command can only be executed from server console</li>
 *   <li><strong>Administrative Access:</strong> Provides server operators with direct currency control</li>
 *   <li><strong>Audit Integration:</strong> All operations are logged for administrative oversight</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Framework Responsibilities:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Registers the command with the evaluation environment</li>
 *   <li>Configures command-specific evaluation parameters</li>
 *   <li>Manages command lifecycle within the plugin system</li>
 *   <li>Provides configuration access to the command implementation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Context:</h3>
 * <p>
 * This section is instantiated during plugin initialization and provides the configuration
 * foundation for the {@link CDeposit} command implementation. It ensures proper integration
 * with the plugin's command evaluation framework and maintains consistency with other
 * console commands in the system.
 * </p>

	 * <h3>Environment Configuration:</h3>
	 * <p>

	 * components required for currency operations.
