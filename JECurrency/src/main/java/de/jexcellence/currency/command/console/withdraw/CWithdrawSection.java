/**
 * Command section configuration for the console-based currency withdrawal command.
 * <p>
 * This section serves as the configuration and registration component for the "cwithdraw"
 * console command within the JECurrency plugin's command evaluation framework. It extends
 * the abstract command section to provide specific configuration for withdrawal operations
 * that can only be executed from the server console.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Command Integration:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Command Name:</strong> "cwithdraw" - Console-specific withdrawal command</li>
 *   <li><strong>Execution Context:</strong> Server console only (no player access)</li>
 *   <li><strong>Framework Integration:</strong> Integrates with the GPEEE evaluation system</li>
 *   <li><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Handles command-specific settings and permissions</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Security Model:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Console Restriction:</strong> Command can only be executed from server console</li>
 *   <li><strong>Administrative Access:</strong> Provides server operators with direct currency control</li>
 *   <li><strong>Balance Validation:</strong> Ensures withdrawal operations respect balance limits</li>
 *   <li><strong>Audit Integration:</strong> All operations are logged for administrative oversight</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Framework Responsibilities:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Registers the command with the evaluation environment</li>
 *   <li>Configures command-specific evaluation parameters</li>
 *   <li>Manages command lifecycle within the plugin system</li>
 *   <li>Provides configuration access to the command implementation</li>
 *   <li>Establishes validation rules for withdrawal operations</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Context:</h3>
 * <p>
 * This section is instantiated during plugin initialization and provides the configuration
 * foundation for the {@link CWithdraw} command implementation. It ensures proper integration
 * with the plugin's command evaluation framework and maintains consistency with other
 * console commands in the system. The withdrawal command requires additional validation
 * to prevent overdrafts and maintain account integrity.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Operational Considerations:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Balance Verification:</strong> Withdrawal operations must validate sufficient funds</li>
 *   <li><strong>Transaction Integrity:</strong> Ensures atomic operations to prevent data corruption</li>
 *   <li><strong>Error Recovery:</strong> Provides graceful handling of failed withdrawal attempts</li>
 *   <li><strong>Audit Compliance:</strong> Maintains comprehensive logs for financial oversight</li>
 * </ul>

	/**
	 * Constructs a new console withdrawal command section with the specified evaluation environment.
	 * <p>
	 * This constructor initializes the command section with the necessary configuration to
	 * integrate with the GPEEE evaluation framework. The evaluation environment builder
	 * provides the context and configuration needed for command processing, including
	 * variable resolution, expression evaluation, and execution context management.

	 *   <li>Establishes integration with the plugin's command framework</li>
	 *   <li>Configures withdrawal-specific validation rules</li>

	 *
	 * <h3>Environment Configuration:</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * The evaluation environment builder provides access to plugin services, configuration
	 * settings, and runtime context that the command implementation will need during
	 * execution. This includes access to repositories, adapters, balance validation
	 * services, and other infrastructure components required for secure withdrawal operations.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <h3>Security Integration:</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * The constructor ensures that the command section is properly configured with
	 * appropriate security constraints for withdrawal operations, including balance
	 * validation, transaction logging, and error handling mechanisms that prevent
	 * unauthorized or invalid currency modifications.
